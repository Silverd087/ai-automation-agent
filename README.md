# AI Automation Agent ðŸš€

This project is an MVP automation system where you can tell the agent what to do in plain English (e.g. "Search YouTube for lofi playlists and return the top 5 results").

The workflow is:

Planner (Gemini) â€“ Converts natural language into structured steps (JSON).

Executor (Playwright) â€“ Runs those steps inside a browser (navigation, filling forms, scraping, etc.).

FastAPI Backend â€“ Provides endpoints to submit instructions, run tasks, and retrieve results.

SQLite Storage â€“ Persists task history and scraped outputs.

ðŸ”¹ Stack: FastAPI Â· Google Gemini API Â· Playwright Â· SQLite
ðŸ”¹ Goal: Show how LLMs + automation frameworks can combine to create a simple but powerful AI agent.
